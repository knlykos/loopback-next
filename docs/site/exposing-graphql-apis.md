## Overview

The [OASGraph module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oasgraph) creates a GraphQL
wrapper for existing REST APIs which are described by the OpenAPI specification.
This tutorial shows how to expose GraphQL APIs in an existing LoopBack
application.

### Prerequisite

1.  Install the OASGraph CLI globally by running:

    ```sh
    npm i -g oasgraph-cli
    ```

2.  Make sure you have a running LoopBack 4 application. In this tutorial, we'll
    use the `todo` example. You can create this application by running the
    command below:

    ```sh
    lb4 example todo
    ```

### Start the GraphQL Server

Make sure your LoopBack application is running by going to
`http://localhost:3000/openapi.json`. If not, you can start it by running the
`npm start` command.

Now we will use the oasgraph CLI to set up a GraphQL HTTP Server backed by
express on port 3001. Specifying the OpenAPI spec generated by the
todo-application as the parameter, start up the server by running the following
command:

```sh
oasgraph http://localhost:3000/openapi.json
```

That’s it! You’re now ready to try out some tests and requests in the browser at
http://localhost:3001/graphql.

{% include note.html content="
We are looking into ways how to expose the GraphQL endpoint alongside the main REST API,
on the same HTTP host and port. See
[issue #1905](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1905).

### Try Out the GraphQL APIs

Here are some examples of the `query` and `mutation` calls:

1. To get all the to-do instances, run this query command:

```
 query{
   todos {
     id
     title
     desc
   }
 }
```

The expected output looks like this:

```json
{ "data": { "todos": [
      { "id": 1, "title": "Take over the galaxy", "desc": "MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" },
      { "id": 2, "title": "destroy alderaan", "desc": "Make sure there are no survivors left!" },
      {"id": 3, "title": "terrorize senate", "desc": "Tell them they're getting a budget
  cut." },
      { "id": 4, "title": "crush rebel scum", "desc": "Every.Last.One." }
] } }
```

2. Create a to-do instance and retrieve its ID and title in the response object
   using the following mutation command:

```
 mutation {
   postTodos(todoInput: {
     title: "Take over the universe"
   }) {
     id
     title
   }
 }
```

The expected output looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "postTodos": {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Take over the universe"
    }
  }
}
```
